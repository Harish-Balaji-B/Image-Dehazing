# Image-Dehazing
The research goal is to quantitatively evaluate the performance of DCP Morphology and CAP HLP, individually and in combination with CLAHE, in improving image visibility and quality under hazy conditions. The findings aim to guide the selection and optimization of dehazing methods for enhanced computer vision in challenging environmental scenarios.
